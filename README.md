This is a clean sign up page. However, there is some focus animation on "input" that I build with tips from a Youtube channel "darkcode".

What did I learn?

- train center position;
- train hover/focus functionalities;
- colors.

That's all for now.

Contact me for any suggestions or help me to improve my DEV skills I will love it <3
